no point as he doesnt hear me or is so distract that I get a ummm ya a few minut after I ask him a question game widow ha becom a comed term for women who have been shut out by male gamer but for some it is not in the least funni anoth correspond wrote I believ that he is addict to the onlin game and that is the caus of hi depress and restless and some of them are even sadder today our son wa five day old the sad truth is my husband spent hour today play hi warcraft game He did not interact with our sweet tini babi becaus there were import quest wait onlin video game fan often complain that their hobbi is misunderstood or marginalis but as game becom ever more mainstream and game ever more immers there will be no hide place for social problem I wish hour a week wa unusu but I think it probabl isnt An hour stretch isnt that surpris ive known peopl to play hour at a stretch I know of peopl who are spend their week holiday from work play warcraft I know of peopl who would play evercrack in shiftswak at am to take over from their friend and resum wait for an item they need to appear I understand that the key sign of an addict is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life By all standard mani of us are addict So is the solut to forc ourselv to stop playingor do we just need to make real life a bit more interest sadli with all the talk of peopl becom obsess with game I find myself long to have the time to join them I have been in a long term relationship for over year sinc that began game have becom more and more complex and more and more so I find I have less and less time to play them with and marriag and work be the main drag on my time I think the line between play a game a lot and a game addict is realli quit distinct I play game a lot defin over hour a week but I dont go miss work or other commit in order to play game I have about a year ago delet everi game on my comput rpg are the worst the real world fade and all your worri sorround a new magic staff or mighti sword unlik book or perhap even TV you gain absolut noth when you stop play your at the same point as when you start all the achiev of your hour session are irretriev lock in the game and sinc youv gain noth in the real world you may as well pile on more achiev in the fake one despit have littl monetari valu the reward and encourag offer by these mmorpg is enough to hook game for hour daili If onli busi could learn to leverag that veri simpli human need for easili measur progress and recognit perhap the unhealthili obsess simpli need more recognit for their achiev in realiti My advic to game widow is if you cant beat em join em that is tri play it yourself If he want to play as well well at least youll be togeth somewher I wa an addict and it cost me my relationship I still play now but without the guilt hehe how long have i play in one sit from morn till the earli hour of the next day the bird were sing out side and i had to hobbl to the bath room co my bladder wa so full i wa in pain i would hardli eat perhap some toast smoke endlessli and drink now thank the fascin ha worn off and I have a girlfriend but still no job for the most part onlin game give me an adict to illusori achiev and as there is no end in sight you keep go for the mirag of the ultim obsess behaviour is of cours alway caus for concern but it alway bother me when articl about game talk in term of realiti obvious somebodi who spend thirti hour a week play everquest ha a problem thi problem howev ha noth to do with a dysfunct sens of realiti An obsess EQ player doe not consid the game to be real ani more than for exampl an obsess automot tinker consid their car to be human If mmorpg have a uniqu danger in term of encourag obsess behaviour it is not that they creat an absorb virtual world but rather that they can be easili access the problem here doe not lie with the natur of game but with the natur of modern hour cultur the problem with these so call mmorpg is that you can never realli complet them there alway anoth quest to do A few of my friend have onli had about hour sleep sinc it wa releas friday championship manag consum my life for year one particular session start at about pm on a sunday paus for a brief sleep at am on the monday and after visit to univers for class restart at about midday for anoth hour session the peopl who tend to hark on about about the problem of hardcor game seem to be those who have rare allow themselv to becom immers in a game I would expect their perspect to chang if they were to do that I use to be an everquest addict while I wa in colleg It came to the point where the game world felt more real than the real one I fail alot of my cours and wa abl to bare graduat I wa lucki that I came to my

where I wa eat my dinner in front of the PC I realis thing were get silli so Im tri not to spend so much time on there it not easi I feel as if ive got a real addict go on here for me the problem is that I love to complet a goal onc it is complet that is it I am finish time to move on I becom obsess to complet the goal so from that standpoint it is an addict In a game where you will never complet an ultim goal well it would be like fall into a black pit It is easier to escap into a control fantasi world than face realiti at time in other word the goal offer in the PC game are easier and more fun than the real world pretti scari implic if you think about it I cant buy world of warcraft as it would destroy my marrag I just know it I play star war galaxi for about a year and can attest to the addict of these game they are all engin in such a way that earli on in the game you progress quickli but thi progress becom exponenti slower requir more and more time to reach the next level Im

get out even met someon and got marri ha my life chang hell no I still cast spell and battl till the earli hour of the morn On with the fun onlin game should be enjoy just as much as you would enjoy watch televis or go to the cinema or the pub with your mate mani peopl use recreat drug on an occasion basi and are abl to lead succesful live with famili relationship and good career A minor allow drug to take over and destroy their live and becom addict accord to thi articl the same is true of mmorpg the messag to the govern is clear either legalis drug or outlaw onlin game sound like there are some sad stori here and I can believ them all I play alot of warcraft myself and know full well how addict it is I am resolut that it will not take over my life It certainli get in the way though I think that some peopl simpli do not know how to draw thi line or lack the willpow to stop themselv step over it I think Im obsess with game in gener I spend far too much time play game like everquest and footbal manag rather than go out and interact with real peopl and when I do tri to Im alway think in the back if my mind that Id rather be in front of the comput win the leagu with cambridg unit I am obsess with onlin role play game it not so much quest but it ha the adrenalin of a real life situat goal to achiev etc I spend about five hour per day onlin play it and I rare get more than four to five hour sleep befor get up for work the next morn As mani of the player spend their time in mmorpg rather than in front of the TV I fail to see how it will affect player social live neg furthermor these type of game contain a huge social aspect wherea other game and some other pursuit such as be a couch potato the player could be indulg in are solitari by natur these game

organ furri recycl have alreadi had one bigscreen outing s wombl free but with environment issu still occupi our thought it is high time they made a comeback advanc in special effect technolog could do wonder for the bbc supernatur comedi and the success of pirat of the caribbean must sure herald a comeback for tv most popular cartoon buccan It might also remind viewer the lewd charact name often associ with the show never actual exist the magic roundabout is out in the UK on februari how about bring catweazl to the big screen He could give gandalf a run for hi money thundercat I love it should be fun to see on the big screen if some effort is put in it will bring my youth back get your hand off the clanger Is noth sacr make a movi version of the banana split what about keanu reev and richard gere in a remak of the wooden top Or perhap robbi william could get hi much moot act career off the ground by take on the role of andi pandi you forgot to mention the grearest of them all danger mous but then again it couldnt be better than the origin seri could it it alway nice to see these old toon rereleas but after the abysm thunderbird movi and the song I think ive been complet put off just leav these classic alon as good memori I think remak are a good idea As the world move on peopl tend to look more and more into the past to thing that make them feel safe I believ thi is the whole reason retro ha becom so popular As long as a remak doe justic to the origin then all it can do is creat a wider audienc and possibl entic a new gener of person to enjoy and reviv and old seri person id like to see cartoon such as transform thundercat and mask get full hollywood remak leav them alon whi ruin someth that we all have veri fond memori of in the first place the thunderbird film wa apal not a patch on the puppet seri I grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voic of eric thompson love to see transform with real actor and cgi and make it at least a rate part of the reason for the success of such classic as the magic roundabout wa that the charact were not the sweet and cuddli creatur that you would expect they were moodi sarcast and rather human just look at the pictur of the anim for the new film show that these characterist have not been preserv dougal never smile like that film of thi sort have an unfortun habit of disneyfi everth and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place I have fond memori of bod not least of which becaus I look like him and would like to see someon attempt to make it into a film it got all the right materi for an american blockbust no plot and no stori bod would like be play by tom cruis and would undoubtedli have a girlfriend or two it all veri well and good remak these classic TV show and film with all the latest technolog for a new audienc but for me a lot of the origin charm is lost when they do thi and seem more like a money make exercis to cash in on the origin success of the programm than reinvent or improv it It mayb that to an audienc who have never seen the origin they can watch them without prejudic but to peopl who have grown up with all these show such as thunderbird and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood they are never go to live up to expect It doe pose the question though that with all the long line of remak be made are filmmak run out of origin idea all I can say is bring back danger mous probabl the greatest kid show ever I recent rewatch some episod and realis that there wa a level of humour shown in danger mous that wa complet lost on me when I wa a child there wa a new captain pugwash cartoon made a coupl of year back again like so mani of these nostalgia programm the anim thi time comput creat flatcel like anim fail to match the origin cut out paper techniqu for invent and wa woefulli inadequ We live in a sampl world the music industri ha been pluder past decad for inspir clip sound from year ago is much cheaper and easier that do someth new seem that the film and TV is do the same now it just cheaper to take idea from the past and rework them rather than be dare and tri someth new It got to be mrbenn the stori line about a man who chang in a fanci dress shop step into a door way and appear in anoth time and place would be amaz If they got a decent produc and writer the stori line could be great and who to play the lead role well if it wa a comedi then it would have to be someon like steve martin If it go to be an adventur then johnni depp play a role similar to the pirat Of the caribbean charact muffin the mule perhap after all granni and grandpa go to the cinema as well you know whi cant the british film industri tri make gerri anderson ufo or captain scarlet or saphir and steel or the tomorrow peopl In today media it seem the past is the futur TV show such as battlestar galactica have new remak dj are sampl or rework s and s music even comput game from year ago are get modern rework person I think it show that no one ha ani origin ani more whi not just leav our mistyey nostalgia alon mari mungo and midg but of cours for most of the episod the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stair plu would mari be more of a vicki pollard charact as she live in a high rise council block yeah but no but I wasnt even there Id like to see Mr benn with brad pitt in the titl role sean conneri could play the mysteri costum shop owner It demonstr a profound lack of imagin in today filmmak that they continu tri to remak and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia there are plani of modern children book that would make excel film or TV programm whi not use them instead of rehash the past Mr benn with rowan atkinson as the lead would have love to see dungeon dragon made but unfortun the film that it wa made into didnt come up to scratch the onli one that isnt to be remad as yet is thundercat which Id like to see Im an expat live in

go up against the spongebob squarep movi popular among children becaus it origin witti and modern the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those mani year ago how about classic like chorlton and the wheeli rentaghost terrahawk bodoh the list could go on and on If a transform movi is inde on the card then ill be the first one on amazon buy a copi eagerli wait at the front door with a frothi mouth and a nervou twitch repackag my childhood and sell it to me at an extortion price I dont care till then ill have to make do with the citreon C advert Id luv to see

bring it to the big screen is that noon could approach oliv postgat wonder voic So in gener leav well alon the origin are good becaus they are of their time and the method use are an integr part of

mockauthent style I might be interest chorton and the wheeli or jami and hi magic torch that would be mega thi regurgit of old film and TV show make me angri it is corpor lazi rest on the safeti of

    "Tf-idf stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency, and the tf-idf weight is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus. Variations of the tf-idf weighting scheme are often used by search engines as a central tool in scoring and ranking a document's relevance given a user query.\n",
